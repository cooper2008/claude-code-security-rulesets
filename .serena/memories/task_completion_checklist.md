# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Submitting Code

### 1. Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues
- [ ] Run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting  
- [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`
- [ ] Check all imports use path mapping (`@/*` instead of relative paths)

### 2. Testing Requirements
- [ ] Run `npm test` and ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Add unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Performance tests must show <100ms validation time
- [ ] Integration tests for CLI commands

### 3. Security Validation
- [ ] No `console.log` usage (use `console.warn` or `console.error` only)
- [ ] No `eval`, `new Function`, or other dangerous patterns
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Input validation for all user-provided data

### 4. TypeScript Standards
- [ ] All functions have explicit return types
- [ ] No `any` types (use proper typing)
- [ ] All public APIs have TSDoc comments
- [ ] Strict null checks pass
- [ ] No unused variables or imports

### 5. Performance Requirements
- [ ] CLI commands respond in <200ms
- [ ] Validation engine completes in <100ms
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable for enterprise use
- [ ] No blocking operations in CLI interface

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Update relevant TSDoc comments
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update memory files if architecture changes
- [ ] Verify examples in code work correctly

## Final Validation Command
```bash
npm run validate
```
This runs linting, testing, and building in sequence.
